                <h3>Hello, I am Ethan</h3>
                <p>I created this website to showcase everything I've learned so for in i101. I used my html and css skills and knowlege of bootstrap to create this. This is the home page. On the home page I have an "about me" section and a "project" section. At the top of the page I included a navigational bar that can take you from the home page to my resume. At the botton of the page, in my footer, I included my authenticity statement aswell as a link to my citation page.</p>

            <div class="projexpla">
            <p>This was the website I created for my week 4 lab check. It was created in HTML and CSS and I used the bootstrap framework to create it. The website describes in great detail my hometown, Hinsdale IL. In the website you can see I included a picture of downtown Hinsdale. Under that I mentioned the Highschool I went to, where Hinsdale is located, and its population as of 2020.</p>

                        <p>Last year for my Business Presentations class I had to create a slideshow and give a presentation about my most admired business leader and I chose to do mine of Howard Shultz. This was an individual project. I talked about Howard Shultz's humble beginnings and how he came to create one of the most well-known businesses in the world, Starbucks.</p>
